A web-based system for managing legal financial commitments across different departments, with built-in validation for available funds and CFPP (Preventive Financial Control) visa workflow.

## Core Features
1. Legal Commitment Management
   - Creation of new commitments by department users 
   - Association with categories, funding sources, and budget articles
   - Automatic numbering system (YYYY-NNNN format)
   - Modification tracking (increases/decreases)
   - Available funds validation

2. Budget Control
   - Real-time validation against available budget
   - Tracking of committed amounts vs. total budget
   - Prevention of over-commitment
   - Historical tracking of budget changes

3. User Interface
   - Department-specific views
   - Commitment creation/modification dialogs
   - History viewing capability
   - Real-time validation feedback

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Vue 3 + Quasar + Nuxt 3)
1. Main Components:
   - Legal Commitments Page (`q-page`)
   - Add Commitment Dialog
   - Modify Amount Dialog
   - History Dialog

2. Key Composables:
   - `useAngajamente`:
     - Manages commitment state and operations
     - Handles API communication
     - Provides validation functions
     - Manages loading states

### Backend (Nuxt Server Routes)
1. Main Endpoints:
   ```
   GET /api/angajamente?an={year}
   POST /api/angajamente
   POST /api/angajamente/{id}/modificari
   POST /api/angajamente/validate
   ```

2. Core Operations:
   - Commitment creation with automatic numbering
   - Budget validation
   - Modification tracking
   - Available funds calculation

### Data Model
1. Main Entities:
   - Angajamente (Commitments)
   - Categorii (Categories)
   - SurseFinantare (Funding Sources)
   - ArticoleBugetare (Budget Articles)
   - ModificariAngajamente (Commitment Modifications)

2. Key Relationships:
   - Commitment -> Category -> Funding Source + Budget Article
   - Commitment -> Department
   - Modification -> User
   - Budget -> Funding Source + Budget Article

## Business Rules
1. Commitment Creation:
   - Must have available funds
   - Must be associated with a valid category
   - Must include initial amount and description
   - Automatically numbered within fiscal year

2. Modifications:
   - Can increase or decrease amounts
   - Must have justification
   - Increases require available funds
   - Track historical budget state

3. Validation:
   - Real-time available funds check
   - Department-specific category access
   - User authorization checks

## Technical Considerations
1. State Management:
   - Reactive data handling with Vue 3 refs
   - Centralized composable for commitment operations
   - Real-time UI updates

2. Performance:
   - Efficient budget calculations
   - Transaction-based operations
   - Optimized queries with proper includes

3. Security:
   - User context validation
   - Department-level access control
   - Transaction-based data integrity

## Future Development Areas
1. Potential Enhancements:
   - Advanced filtering and search
   - Reporting capabilities
   - Bulk operations
   - Document attachments
   - Workflow approvals

2. Technical Improvements:
   - Caching strategy
   - Real-time updates
   - Batch operations
   - PDF export
   - Audit logging
